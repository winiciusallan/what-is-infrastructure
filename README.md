# What is Infrastructure
IT infrastructure is a set of componenents that together serve to deliver services and computing resources. Among these components are included software, hardware, network, data storage and others.

Nowadays, exists many types of infra. Tha main ones are the traditional and those that use cloud computing.
- Traditional: All components are managed by the company itself in datacenters that are located in their facilities.
- Cloud: Cloud computing is provide the resources across the internet, managed by softwares that delivers machines, storage, network and so on.
Has been more common the use of public Cloud as AWS, Azure, GCP and many others, but you can also build your own cloud environment with Open-source project as [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/)

## Understanding infrastructure and virtualization
### Motivations
In the past, is easy to see physical servers with individual tasks, individual purposes, individual operating systems. In a first moment, that seems good, because we separate equally what which server will run, but this
wastes a lot of computing resources that will end up being unused. That way, rises a technology to virtualize that resources which we call **virtualization**.

### How does it work?

## Virtual Machine x Container
Some text here (again)

## Infrastructure as Code
Lorem ipsum



## Getting your hands dirty
Some practice here with terraform, ansible and docker
```hcl
terraform init
```
